# Esri Components: A web component based UI library for JavaScript mapping applications

Esri's new design system (Calcite) provides a library of patterns and ready-to-use, reusable components to help developers easily build consistent Esri-branded web applications. In this session, you'll learn about web components, the foundation of Calcite components, how to navigate the documentation to find the appropriate component for your app, and how to integrate the components into an application.
