# Esri Components: A web component based UI library for JavaScript mapping applications

The new Esri Design System (EDS) provides a library of patterns and ready-to-use, reusable components to help developers easily build consistent Esri-branded web applications. In this session, you'll learn about web components, the foundation of EDS components, how to navigate the documentation to find the appropriate component for your app, and how to integrate the components into an application.
